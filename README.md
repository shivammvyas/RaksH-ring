#  Raksh Ring — AI-Powered Smart Safety Wearable

###  Overview
**Raksh Ring** is a conceptual prototype of a **smart wearable safety device** designed to enhance **women’s safety** through **AI, IoT, and embedded systems**.  
The device is **compact, discreet, and intelligent** — fitting comfortably on a finger like a ring while enabling **instant distress alerts** using integrated sensors and wireless communication.

This project merges **electronics design, AI-driven event detection, and cloud-connected safety systems** into a next-generation personal safety solution.

###  Objective
To develop a **low-cost, AI-enabled wearable ring** that can:
- Detect distress or abnormal motion automatically using sensors.
- Trigger **manual SOS alerts** through a hidden button (3 taps within 5 seconds).
- Send **real-time location** and alert messages to emergency contacts.
- Integrate with **cloud or smartphone app** for enhanced data analytics and monitoring.
