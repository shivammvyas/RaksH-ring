#  Raksh Ring — AI-Powered Smart Safety Wearable

###  Overview
**Raksh Ring** is a conceptual prototype of a **smart wearable safety device** designed to enhance **women’s safety** through **AI, IoT, and embedded systems**.  
The device is **compact, discreet, and intelligent** — fitting comfortably on a finger like a ring while enabling **instant distress alerts** using integrated sensors and wireless communication.

This project merges **electronics design, AI-driven event detection, and cloud-connected safety systems** into a next-generation personal safety solution.

###  Objective
To develop a **low-cost, AI-enabled wearable ring** that can:
- Detect distress or abnormal motion automatically using sensors.
- Trigger **manual SOS alerts** through a hidden button (3 taps within 5 seconds).
- Send **real-time location** and alert messages to emergency contacts.
- Integrate with **cloud or smartphone app** for enhanced data analytics and monitoring.

|  Component |  Purpose |
|--------------|------------|
| **ESP32 / Arduino Nano 33 BLE** | Core microcontroller handling sensor input, button logic (3-tap detection), and communication |
| **Push Button / Capacitive Touch Sensor** | Manual SOS trigger — activates alert when pressed **3 times within 5 seconds** |
| **GPS Module (NEO-6M)** | Tracks and provides real-time location data during alerts |
| **GSM Module (SIM800L)** | Sends SMS or initiates call to emergency contacts |
| **Bluetooth (Built-in / BLE)** | Connects to mobile app for AI-based event detection and logging |
| **Li-ion / Li-Po Battery (10–20 mAh)** | Power source for the ring device |
| **Accelerometer/Gyroscope (ICM-20948)** | Detects gestures or distress motion patterns |
| **LED / Vibration Motor** | Provides haptic or visual feedback on successful SOS activation |
| **AI/Cloud Integration (Optional)** | Learns user behavior patterns to auto-detect distress situations |
